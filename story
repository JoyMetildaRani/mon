there was a monkey and it was naughty, there was a cap seller walking around selling caps. monkey saw the cap seller and wanted to have those caps. when cap seller was so tired and slept under a tree, the monkey took the cpas away which made the cap seller feel bad when he woke up and saw all these things. he had a cleaver idea and threw his cap down as a result of which the monkey also threw the cap down. The End.... there was a mountain beneath...there was great fish and the world was shaking
